# Tableau Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my curated portfolio of Tableau dashboards—built to demonstrate business intelligence, data storytelling, and dashboard design skills across a range of domains including **Sales**, **Human Resources**, and **Electric Vehicles**.

I would like to thank [Baraa Khatib Salkini](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa) for inspiring the design and approach of these dashboards. Your guidance and creativity have been invaluable in shaping this portfolio.


Each project simulates real-world business use cases, combining interactive visuals, dynamic filters, and actionable insights to support decision-making.
