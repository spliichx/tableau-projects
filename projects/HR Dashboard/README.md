## üß© Project Purpose

Modern HR teams are expected to move beyond spreadsheets and instinct. They need fast, reliable insights to support strategic decisions ‚Äî from identifying turnover risks to spotting pay gaps and understanding talent distribution.

This dashboard addresses that need by transforming raw HR data into actionable intelligence, accessible through a clean, user-focused interface.

## Problem Statement

HR data often sits across disconnected systems, making it difficult to form a cohesive picture of the organization. Without the ability to explore workforce trends or dive into individual records, HR managers risk making decisions without the full context. This dashboard solves that by consolidating key metrics ‚Äî from hiring patterns to demographic makeup ‚Äî into a unified, visual analytics tool.

#### 1. Overview
